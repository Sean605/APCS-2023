## Project Description:

We made a 3D game where you walk around and press buttons

## What I learned

- I learned how to use Blender to make a 3D character and how to rig it for animation (kind of).  I already somewhat knew Blender, but it was very little and I learned a lot more that I didn't already know.  
- I also learned a little bit of Unity, even though it wasn't technically my part of the project, I still watched some tutorials, and I hadn't used Unity at all before this.  

## How you can try it

There will be a file to download to play the game and then you play the game

## Why this is cool

It's a 3D game.  3D games are cool and kinda hard to make at least for someone who is very new to it (which is 3 of the 4 of us).  
They're also cooler than 2D games because there's like a whole other dimension
