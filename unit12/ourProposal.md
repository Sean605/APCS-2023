Aaron, Logan, Sean, and Will's Whimsical Little Project.  

# Project Proposal: 3D Platformer Game

Our goal is to better our skills of using Unity and coding in C# by making a simple 3D platformer that we can play. 

We are also going to make our own assets in blender, and maybe do some shaders if we have time.  

# Decomposition

1. Get Unity working for everyone in the group
2. Make a movable character object
3. Make an obstacle object that the character can collide with
4. Start designing level(s)
5. Create assets to assign to objects we've made
6. (Optional) Create or implement shaders 

# We will learn:

- Coding in C#
- Game development workflow
- Using blender to make 3D assets
- Level design in a 3D space
